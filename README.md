# Interpp
Light-weight C++ scripting interpretor library

Interpp is a light-weight C++ interpretor library designed specifically for C++ developers who wish to add scripting capabilities to their new or existing C++ projects. Interpp allows you to expose objects from a C++ application to an embedded interpreter interface for run-time scripting.

Interpp is comprised of only 2 files: a header and a cpp file. All you need to do to get started with Interpp is simply add these files in your C++ project and #include <interpp.h>.

An example project is also included in order to demo Interpp's usage.
